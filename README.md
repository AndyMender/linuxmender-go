A small Web development project for my personal website/blog
---

This project is being built using:
- front-end: HTML/CSS with probably [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) and [beego](https://github.com/astaxie/beego://github.com/astaxie/beego)
- back-end: Go with [go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)
- Web serving: [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

The project might follow the venerable [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), though I am not sure yet.

*It's largely a work-in-progress!*
