  After days of venturing through the forest of Bodhi trees, all ragged and bruised, I stumbled upon the most peculiar view I 
  have seen in my life. Far into the horizon stretched a vast field of what would be later known to me as Peppermint OS. I took a 
  deep breathe and inhaled the refreshing smell of peppermint...
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  That is exactly how I felt about Peppermint OS. It was light, refreshing and had that flare to it. By some Peppermint OS is 
  considered <em>the Linux Mint of Lubuntu</em>. Although quite inaccurate, this statement is not so far from truth. Looking at 
  the basic components of this distribution, we have <b>Chromium</b> as the default Internet browser, <b>LXDE</b> as the desktop 
  environment, <b>PCManFM</b> as the file manager and <b>Openbox</b> as the window manager. Apart from that we also have a number 
  of office applications which can help us get started with writing documents, preparing spreadsheets or reading .pdf files. 
  Honestly, that is nothing special as most distributions I’ve worked with so far offered as much. However, there were a few 
  things I found truly refreshing about Peppermint OS.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Firstly, some of the applications aren’t really installed on your hard drive, but are rather applets, which link to specific 
  sites on the Internet through independent instances of Chromium. That is exactly what authors of Peppermint OS meant by 
  cloud-centric when talking about the operating system’s reliance on external content. Additional applets can be easily created 
  using <b>Ice</b>, also part of the default installation. Back in my Windows days (how hilarious does it sound, eh?) every time 
  I saw someone trying to incorporate a browser applet as part of an offline application, I would get instantly mad. By default 
  that browser was Internet Explorer. Probably not the most reasonable choice for handling complex scripts (to put it gently...). 
  Nevertheless, Peppermint OS does it right! Kudos to the authors!
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Secondly, something I have not seen in any distribution before – games. Yes, Peppermint OS comes with a few of those 
  pre-installed and I really liked them, especially the system’s hallmark <b>Entanglement</b>. The game is yet another 
  Chromium-based applet, this time relying on Adobe Flash Player (also immediately accessible and functional). It reminded me of 
  the good old office games present on Windows (Freecell, Solitaire, Minesweeper, etc.).
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Thirdly, as Peppermint OS uses the Ubuntu LTS repositories, the user immediately has access to countless applications through 
  the Synaptic Package Manager. Luckily for me, a complete set of nVidia drivers (including nvidia-prime) was present.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  A bit unfortunately, Peppermint OS is not without shortcomings. For instance, browser applets in reality require more resources 
  than normal applications, since each launches a new instance of the browser engine. Chromium, although possibly the best 
  browser for Linux, is definitely not the lightest. Therefore, after launching several applets at the same time RAM usage can 
  really skyrocket. Still, I felt that Peppermint OS, much like its vast metaphorical fields of peppermint, will always be a 
  place for me to return to when in need of refreshment...
