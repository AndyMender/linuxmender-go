  In <a target="--blank" href="/012">one of my earlier entries</a> I wrote a bit about systemd, but I did not elaborate on it 
  sufficiently. The time has come.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  To those unfamiliar with the topic, systemd is a Linux init system, but also a device and service manager. It governs the boot 
  sequence, drive mounting, networking, etc. In other words, it's pivotal to the proper functioning of a Linux operating system.
  It was originally developed as a pet project by a Red Hat employee, Lennard Poettering. After initial resistance from Red Hat, 
  it gained enough traction in the Linux community to be included in Fedora, Arch Linux and much, much later in Debian, Ubuntu 
  and finally back in CentOS and RHEL.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  In and of itself, systemd doesn't sound like a bad idea - <b>an effort to unify and standardize the Linux ecosystem</b>. 
  Fantastic, right? The issues become slightly more noticeable when one looks under the hood. 
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Firstly, systemd seems to have been designed in a vacuum, with complete disregard for the design principles behind Unix-like 
  operating systems. I'm talking about <b>transparency</b> (parsable clear-text log files and program output), <b>modularity</b> 
  (each component can be used independently, but when used together they display incredible synergy) and <b>ease of understanding</b> 
  (it is apparent what each component does, without the need to study it thoroughly). Systemd is none of that. More so, it falls 
  prey to bugs which had been addressed in other Unix system software in the past and could be considered <em>obvious exploits</em>.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Secondly, it was adopted too rapidly. See: the mention of critical bugs before, and the fact that the Linux ecosystem was not 
  ready for a change of such a caliber. What I mean is a migration from convoluted and ugly System V init Shell scripts to 
  poorly-documented, beta-quality service unit definitions in INI format. Things could and did go horribly wrong sometimes, like 
  services failing and getting constantly restarted without ever reaching an <em>active</em> state or services blocking each 
  other due to unfulfilled dependencies. 
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Thirdly, systemd led to accidental vendor lock-in in the case of major projects like the KDE and GNOME desktop environments. 
  This fact was somewhat neglected, because systemd was being continuously marketed as modern, intuitive and useful. This is true 
  to some extent, but I feel that the Linux ecosystem suffered more than it profited from this arrangement. After all, the very 
  definition of Linux has always been <b>choice</b>. The right to decide on the distribution, installed software, programming 
  environment. Perhaps also the init system? We used to have System V init scripts, Upstart, OpenRC, etc. I admit, none of these 
  systems is / was perfect, but up until now we at least had a choice. Let's have a look at OpenRC as a case study.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  OpenRC is one of the init system options available in Gentoo (systemd being the other). It utilizes a global Unix-inspired 
  configuration file <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> to manage core aspects of the boot process. OpenRC also handles drive mounting and 
  manages system services via the <code>rc-service</code> module. In principle, it serves the same role as systemd with a number 
  of exceptions:
</p>

<ul class="collection">
  <li class="collection-item">
    Init scripts are independent of each other and a broken service can be quickly restored (systemd routes services through a 
    central supervisor called <code>systemctl</code>, which if broken, makes systemd unusable)
  </li>
  <li class="collection-item">
    OpenRC does not replace anything nor does it force users to rely on it. It is a service manager / init system and nothing 
    more. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="flow-text">
  As nothing directly depends on OpenRC, I am free to do whatever I want with my operating system. Problems start when one 
  wants to use a more feature-complete desktop environment like MATE, for instance. It's similar to Xfce, GNOME3 and KDE, but 
  more akin to the look and feel of GNOME2. Hence, a perfectly reasonable choice, even for weaker computers. However, in order to 
  use any of the major desktops one needs systemd or at least some bits of it.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  I find it quite reasonable that popular desktop environments try to take advantage of systemd, but why, God why, does it have 
  to be mandatory? Why do I need to limit myself to a specific init system, and often by extension to a specific range of 
  distributions (systemd is already quite widespread) to enjoy Linux?
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  I donâ€™t want to sound like one of those tinfoil hat aficionados, but the current systemd craze is slightly troubling, because 
  it brings us a big step closer to Windows and its flaws. Let's bear that in mind!
