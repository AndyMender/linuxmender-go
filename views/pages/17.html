  The event which inspired me to write this entry was my recent laptop purchase and the subsequent struggles. I decided to buy 
  a new computer, as the previous one had a dedicated nVidia graphics card. In general, that's great, because that extra GPU
  power can be used for audio and video decoding via <code>vdpau</code>. However, in my case the discrete graphics chip would 
  quickly overheat, leading to CPU throttling and a dramatic drop in overall performance. Some laptop manufacturers are notorious 
  for that (I'm looking at you, Apple!). This time it was Samsung's fault for pairing a powerful graphics chip with a subpar 
  cooling solution.

<p class="flow-text">
  To the point, though. Having learnt from experience, I took great caution in choosing my future computer. Discrete graphics 
  chips were a no-go, obviously. Also, the laptop had to be as generic as possible to guarantee some degree of Linux 
  compatibility. This turned out to be a very tedious task as most electronics retailers fail to provide all the necessary 
  information. There is a very noticeable difference between Intel HD Graphics 4400 and Intel HD Graphics 3000. You cannot bunch 
  them together as <em>Integrated Intel Graphics</em>! The misinformation <em>crimes</em> committed by laptop manufacturers are 
  even more profound. In the case of some models, it was impossible to get the complete specs even from the manual. More so, 
  these manuals were effectively <em>How to Install Windows on Laptop X</em> guides. I don't understand why some manufacturers 
  like HP, Dell, IBM and Lenovo are willing to disclose technical details of their products, while others like ASUS fail to do so. 
  For Pete's sake! It gets even worse when retailer A says X and retailer B says Y. Who should I trust? I, and many other people, 
  do honestly care whether the wireless adapter in my laptop is a reputable product from Intel or Realtek rather than a cheap 
  no-name knock-off.

  Sadly, the wireless adapter was the matter of debate in my case. The Asus VivoBook I purchased shipped with a Mediatek 7630e 
  wireless card. This specific wireless card is a known troublemaker across all platforms. It truly baffles me why ASUS decided 
  to put one of these in a perfectly decent laptop.

  This prompted me to do a thorough search of USB wireless dongles, for which the specific chipset is known and documented. As of 
  now I am a proud owner of a TP-LINK 725N (containing the Realtek 8188eu wireless chip). It works flawlessly even on minimalist 
  Linux distributions, such as Arch Linux.

  This leads me to the very point of these musings - Linux hardware compatibility. People usually praise Windows for its hardware 
  compatibility from a largely biased perspective of a pre-installed operating system. Sure, if you buy a laptop with Windows on 
  it, chances are that a team of engineers devoted hours of honest work to make it fully functional out-of-the-box. And believe 
  me, some models required truly crazy BIOS hacks to make even Windows run smoothly on them. Now, things arenâ€™t as comfortable 
  when you have to do a fresh installation. Most of the drivers are missing and sometimes even establishing an Internet 
  connection is impossible. This is completely unthinkable in Linux. Every larger distribution makes it a point of personal pride 
  that the system is instantly usable. Obviously, at least a wired connection (via a DHCP daemon) is available to install updates 
  or missing libraries. In addition, the Linux kernel comes with a set of loadable modules to support the majority of hardware 
  - DVD-ROM readers, wireless and wired adapters, SD card readers, etc. Granted, overall hardware compatibility is better on 
  Windows, because companies prioritize Windows in driver development and the OS itself favors backwards compatibility to an 
  extreme degree. However, the out-of-the-box experience of Linux is far, far superior.

<p class="flow-text">
  To sum up, I strongly believe that Linux is not getting as much attention as it deserves. For instance, the TP-LINK 725N USB 
  dongle advertised Win7, Wn8 and Win8.1 compatibility only. Other USB dongles mentioned Linux, but listed outdated kernels 
  (up to version 2.8, while version 3.19 is already in development). This is a joke. Hardware vendors should start paying more 
  attention to Linux as it is a growing force on the market. Smartphones run the Linux-derived Android. Servers everywhere run 
  Linux, because it is <em>the</em> server operating system. Hell, even Valve decided that it is worth investing in Linux 
  (see: SteamOS). I hope hardware manufacturers will follow suit soon enough.
