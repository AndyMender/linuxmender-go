  Bodhi means <em>enlightenment</em>, as I read on Wikipedia. That was exactly what I felt when launching my very first Linux 
  distribution – <b>Bodhi Linux 2.4.0</b>.

<p class="flow-text">
  I started my adventure by completely formatting my hard drive. I really wanted to cut the ties with my previous Windows-related 
  life! When I launched the Bodhi Linux live CD, I was immediately welcomed by an optimistic green leaf in the center. Actually, 
  all of the Bodhi panels/menus were ripe with floral accents. The installation concluded flawlessly and I could select my 
  desired desktop layout. I decided to opt for a simple taskbar + system tray at the top and a quick menu for applications at the 
  bottom. I started off with an exploration of the desktop. Everything was different, alien... Fortunately, I quickly learned 
  what software was available to me. There was the Midori Web browser, already familiar to me from my past attempts to make 
  Windows at least slightly more lightweight. However, in Windows Midori had the tendency to crash almost on every website 
  running scripts. Here, though, it worked superbly! Praise Linux!

  Next up was the Enlightenment File Manager. With it I was finally able to browse the content of my hard drive. Luckily, it did 
  not differ much from Windows Explorer. The rest of the features were rather commonplace – an audio volume control, a network 
  manager, etc.

  Bodhi Linux taught me the value of simplicity. It let me rediscover the good old times when operating systems hosted only a 
  handful of applications and could run no more than 2-3 programs at a time due to RAM limitations. I no longer needed the heavy 
  suites offered for MS Windows. Writing was simple, watching videos was simple. Life was simple... However, Bodhi Linux was much 
  more. I chose the 32-bit (x86) edition, but thanks to PAE (Physical Address Extension) I could still use my RAM to full capacity 
  (4GB in total). Overall, an extremely positive experience.
