  Windows, Mac OS X, the BSDs and Linux are all contestants in an intriguing race â€“ a race of technological progress. To be 
  more precise, they occupy slightly different niches in the computing ecosystem, however compete against each other in terms of 
  overall usability (the BSDs to a much lesser extent). 
  Sadly, as both Windows and Mac OS X are the most popular end-user operating systems, the majority of hardware support and 
  development is dedicated to them. Of course, there is also the Linux-based Android on mobile devices! However, Linux itself is 
  not so far behind. More and more end-user features are being introduced to the kernel. For instance, Linux kernel version 3.16 
  adds OS-level response to physical shock, relying on built-in pressure sensors (supported in Windows since XP). The current 
  stable edition of the Linux kernel is already 3.18, while 3.19 is in the testing phase (release candidate 5, 3.19-rc5, can be 
  downloaded from <a target="--blank" href="https://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>).

  Because Linux is an ever-changing software landscape, I decided to settle down with an operating system that would follow the 
  so-called rolling-release development model and could be constantly kept up-to-date. Of the most popular distributions I 
  considered Gentoo, Arch Linux and Debian Sid.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  I tried Gentoo a few months ago and was moderately annoyed with its time-consuming installation. I quickly deemed it too 
  difficult for me, though I might try it again once I gain sufficient experience. From thereon I limited my choices to Arch and 
  Sid.

  Arch Linux is a typical rolling-release distribution, following principles of simplicity and clarity. The installation 
  procedure is almost purely manual (less troublesome than Gentoo, though) and requires adjustments to several configuration 
  files. However, it also provides a very good learning opportunity. The key to success is a combination of up-to-date vanilla 
  binary packages (very similar to the ones available from upstream open-source projects) and easy access to compiling tools.

<p class="flow-text">
  Debian is definitely not a rolling-release distribution, though the Unstable / Sid branch is often considered such. Debian 
  developers regard it as a polygon for new software packages. It will never see an actual versioned release, though, so it is 
  highly debatable whether Sid is a true rolling-release distribution. I greatly appreciate Debian for its versatility and 
  stability, but because even Debian developers themselves deem Sid to be highly unstable (frequent updates may cause dependency 
  errors, etc.) and it does not receive security updates like Testing and Stable in a timely fashion, I decided to leave it for 
  now.

<p class="flow-text">
  Arch Linux is very much a <em>vanilla</em> distribution in the sense that it closely follows the defaults set by upstream 
  projects (third-party software, the kernel, the X Server, etc.). As a result, it's one of the first Linux distributions to 
  receive updates. In a way it puts trust in upstream developer groups. If the kernel team decides that version 3.18 is stable 
  enough to be released, it's deemed stable enough for use in Arch Linux. I guess this attitude gave Arch Linux the reputation of 
  being on the <em>bleeding edge</em> of software development. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's more bug-ridden.

  Debian development standards are much higher, of course. Every upstream package is first accepted into Experimental and 
  Unstable where it is thoroughly processed by multiple dev teams. This guarantees additional testing and the fact that the 
  package will be configured to suit the needs of the average user. However, it may take some time before it lands in Debian 
  Testing and unless it's a security update, it won't appear in Debian Stable until the next release. In addition, the Debian 
  dev teams introduce a number of changes to the configuration of the package to make it fit the rest of the OS. On one hand, it 
  makes the entire operating system more cohesive. The downside is that it introduces bugs. Also, not every upstream developer or 
  dev team is comfortable with releasing only security fixes outside of their regular development cycle or adhering to the 
  development model of downstream Linux distributions (see: 
  <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=819703#158">the XScreenSaver rant in the Debian bug report logs</a>).

  I greatly appreciate the enormous amount of work the Debian dev teams put into the distribution, however the more it diverges 
  from the original state and intent of upstream projects, the more difficult it becomes to troubleshoot third-party software. 
  Thereby, for the time being I decided to roll with Arch Linux. Which distribution would you pick?
