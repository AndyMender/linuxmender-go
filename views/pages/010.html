  Mandrake (also known as Mandragora) is a very interesting plant. The shape of its root often resembles a small, wrinkled 
  creature, almost like a human infant. Therefore, it was considered by alchemists a source of various magical properties. Alas, 
  there was a catch. The <em>cry</em> of a freshly uprooted Mandragora could kill or at least severely incapacitate an
  inexperienced gardener. Mandrake was also a Linux distribution originally forked from Red Hat (as stated on 
  <a href="https://distrowatch.com">DistroWatch</a>), which in 2005 gave birth to Mandriva. Unfortunately, in 2011-2012 Mandriva 
  somehow died down as a PC distribution (that <em>rooten</em> luck...), leaving behind several child projects  – ROSA, PCLinuxOS, 
  Mageia and OpenMandriva Lx. ROSA and PCLinuxOS steadily drifted from the original Mandriva concept, each gaining a new, 
  independent identity. Mageia and OpenMandriva Lx were brought to life to continue Mandriva’s legacy...

  One of the definite strengths of Linux is choice. One is not limited to a single distribution, desktop environment, etc. I 
  myself <em>hop</em> distributions frequently, like a nomad of sorts. However, it pains me greatly when I see good deeds being 
  duplicated and hence partially going to waste or remaining unnoticed. I tried both Mageia and OpenMandriva Lx, and although 
  popularity trends favor Mageia, I can see why OpenMandriva Lx deserves praise. It shows incredible effort and polish from the 
  developers. My live environment and post-installation experience was perfect. OpenMandriva Lx’s take on the KDE desktop was 
  smooth and surprisingly fast. Appealing was also the selection of packages avaiable in the repositories via <em>urpmi</em> 
  (Mandrake’s package manager). Running OpenMandriva Lx for a few days I was very eager to stay with it or at least switch to the 
  KDE desktop environment. My first impression was that encouraging.

  Unfortunately, I could not say as much about Mageia. While the intentions were truly noble, my experience was quite negative. 
  As an operating system Mageia felt heavy and improperly optimized. I tested only the live environment, because the installer 
  was buggy and would take ages to do something other distributions’ installers could do within minutes. Surprisingly, the 
  installer also failed to install the drivers for my wireless network adapter, even though it recognized it correctly!

  In that I saw that Mageia and OpenMadriva Lx are like two sides of a single coin – both parts of a whole, yet never facing each 
  other. There does not seem to be any interaction between the communities, while actually there should! Since it is not such a 
  bad idea, I believe someone has already suggested a merge. Again, it pains me to see how much both distributions would profit 
  if they were one. Alas, such is the downside of freedom in the open-source community.
