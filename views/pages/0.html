  Every story has a beginning. This one is no different. My story begins in my early childhood, when I got my first Nintendo 
  Entertainment System (NES) console. To be completely frank, though it was not the original NES overhyped in those shoddy TV 
  commercials (an image of a perfect American family, mom and dad, two kids, both ecstatically gaming on a NES disconnected 
  from the TV set). It was a <em>genuine</em> (pun intended) Famiclone resembling the Batmobile.

  I opened it up a few years later and noticed how shabby the wiring had been. Surprising it even worked! Nevertheless, I was 
  excited to had gotten it for my birthday as a toddler. It came with 2 pads, a knock-off NES zapper and one of those infamous 
  <em>128-in-1</em> cartridges (10-20 unique games, repeated as hacked varieties). Today that doesn't sound like much, but back 
  then it was paradise. My favourites were <em>Yi Er Kung Fu</em> and <em>Duck Hunt</em>. I didn't like <em>Super Mario Bros</em>
  as much, because I sucked at it. I know, embarrassing... Anyway, I spent entire days gaming on my Famiclone and in time 
  acrued several cool gaming titles, like <em>Darkwing Duck</em>, <em>Duck Tales 1 & 2</em>, <em>Ghost Busters 2</em>, and
  <em>Tom and Jerry</em>. Then, things changed a bit and my adventures with personal computers (PCs) finally began...

  My father is a retired electronics engineer and a hobbyist tinkerer. Incidentally, he is extremely deft at assembling PCs. The 
  first computer I ever owned was built from scratch by him. Thinking about it today makes me incredibly proud of him, but also
  quite jealous! He had the opportunity to grow up along the very first personal computers and gaming consoles, like Atari 2600 
  or Commodore 64 (not to mention the Silicon Graphics SGI workstations and SPARC servers from Sun Microsystems...). My first 
  computer was a Pentium I P5 (P54C of the 80502 architecture, to be exact). It was clocked at 100 MHz and had 32 MB RAM on the 
  motherboard, as far as I remember. I write <em>was</em>, but I think my parents still keep it somewhere in the basement. The PC
  sported the amazing for its time Matrox 3D graphics card and the Sound Blaster Pro sound card. On this <em>beast</em> of a 
  machine I played titles such as <em>Electro Body</em>, <em>The Incredible Machine</em>, <em>Commander Keen</em>, <em>Cosmo's 
  Cosmic Adventures</em> and other great games from the DOS era. Apogee used to make fantastic platformers for the DOS and I 
  remember many of them very fondly. Good old Windows 3.11 also sported some relaxing office games.

  Alas, no hardware lasts forever, especially when it's maintained by a curious and adventurous teenager. It so happened that I 
  accidentally overclocked my graphics card and literally burnt it to a crisp. This is no joke. Nowadays, graphics drivers have 
  a lot of safety mechanisms baked in. Any attempts at changing the suggested clock speed are met with a huge red warning button 
  with a label that says <em>at your own risk</em>. Back then configuring sound and graphics was a bit of an ordeal and one could 
  easily mess things up. Zero hand-holding whatsoever. Since the graphics card had to be replaced anyway, we upgraded the machine 
  with extra RAM and installed Windows 98 on it. It is arguably the second best operating system from Microsoft - a joy to work 
  with and a joy to game on. Absolutely seminal in user-friendly OS design. I received my next computer much much later, when in 
  high school. It was a real powerhouse, though. The pinnacle of its generation, in fact. Pentium IV (with hyper-threading), 2 GB 
  RAM and a GeForce 2 MX graphics card (later upgraded to GeForce 7100). The operating system was Windows XP. Windows 98 was 
  great, but it had its limitations. Windows XP was <em>the shit</em>. The best GUI-centric operating system ever. It was so good 
  that many companies still have support contracts with Microsoft (extended-post-end-of-life-something-something). The later 
  Windows 7 came close, but was not able to repeat that success. For unexplainable reasons since then Microsoft was not able to 
  produce anything equally usable. I really don't want to be harsh, but everything after Windows 7 was a complete disaster from 
  a UX and feature set standpoint. Anyway, my Pentium IV PC still stands at my parents' place, in my former bedroom.

  Fast-forward a couple of years. Pentium IV and 2 GB RAM are not strong enough anymore. For my university work I need something 
  faster. My parents decided it's time for a laptop. They bought me one of those consumer multimedia laptops with a discrete 
  nVidia graphics card (GeForce 520 MX). It came with a one-time <em>gift</em> of free bloatware. Horrible practice, really. I 
  wish laptop vendors would stop polluting their products with trial licenses of software no one actually ever uses. Once I 
  learned the ins and outs of my OS (it required 2 clean installations and several DVDs to get things running properly), it 
  finally struck me – I was not happy with it at all. Windows 7 was not for me. It was packed with countless features I would 
  never use, and I could not disable without potentially breaking the system. Each consecutive update added more bloat, seizing 
  more and more memory. I managed to stop it at 1.5-2 out of 4 GB, though I couldn’t go lower. Surprisingly, a fresh install of 
  Windows 7 64-bit used only around 500-700 MB RAM. Not so much according to current standards. However, I was still a bit 
  unhappy. I needed something to change. Windows 8 was obviously out of the question with its godawful desktop environment. 
  Windows 10 was on the horizon, but previews showed a bizarre combination of Windows 7’s functionality with an improved Windows 
  8 UI environment. Unfortunately, neither was quite my cup of tea...

  The reflection was painful yet refreshing – I had to take a different route, a brave step into the unknown. Into Linux...
