  <br>While reviewing the content of this entry years later I realized that Debian has significantly improved its package 
  management tools and most of below content is outdated. I decided to leave it to give people a historical perspective, though.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Some time ago I decided on Debian as my operating system of choice. It was powerful, flexible and definitely designed with 
  Linux experts in mind. I managed to successfully install it from the minimal netbootCD image on multiple computers, regardless 
  of the hardware. Also, compiling new kernels or recompiling existing ones was a breeze. Thanks to <code>dpkg</code> and 
  <code>kpkg</code>, handling kernels became as simple as installing <code>.deb</code> packages. I greatly enjoyed Debian for the 
  last couple of weeks. However, there was a <em>but</em> (or rather several <em>but(t)s</em>).
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  First off, the output of <code>apt</code> and <code>aptitude</code> is rather unhelpful. Neither of these <code>dpkg</code> 
  front-ends provides complete information about searched for packages. <code>aptitude</code> is slightly better, because it at 
  least gives you a short description for each package. I am aware I can run <code>apt-cache policy</code> to get more info for 
  a particular package, but do I need to do it every single time? Also, only <code>aptitude</code> informs the user whether any 
  of the packages matching his / her search terms have been installed already. Moreover, the syntax for installing packages is 
  needlessly long and complicated. For instance, why are <code>apt-get</code> and <code>apt-cache</code> separate commands, when 
  other distributions use a single interface / app for everything? To top it off, <code>apt-get</code> is far too anticipative 
  in regards to search terms. I'm not sure how does it work exactly, but for the more common keywords I would often get a list of 
  completely unrelated packages.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Secondly, installing packages is an extremely lengthy procedure. Every single time it involves multiple steps - downloading, 
  unpacking, setting up, installing, updating initramfs, etc. Does the initramfs image need to be updated every single time? 
  Really? I thought that's only required when updating the kernel.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  Finally, dependency handling. Debian has this concept of <em>recommended packages</em> - things you might find useful in 
  combination with your currently installed software, for instance <code>-doc</code> packages with documentation. Great idea! 
  However, Debian also makes some pretty big assumptions when it comes to the dependecies of packages selected for installation. 
  Sure, when you're setting up your system for the first time, this might be useful. But what if you want to run some software 
  without the X11 Windowing Server? Nope, not possible! Both <code>apt</code> and <code>aptitude</code> will pull in a boatload 
  of extra packages on the premise that maybe, just maybe, you might want to run also the GUI tool for your headless app. 
  Dependency versioning is a nightmare in its own right. Something Debian is notorious for.
</p>

<p class="flow-text">
  To end my rant I want to say that I love Debian as an operating system. I really do! However, the way it does package 
  management is just clunky and terribly unfriendly to users. Oddly enough, some of the problems went away as I started using 
  the <code>Synaptic</code> GUI tool. Regardless, there exists a distribution that very elegantly addresses all of my issues 
  with Debian â€“ <b>Arch Linux</b>. This time I decided to install it properly, from an Arch Linux liveCD, not Archbang or any 
  other derivative. Fingers crossed!
