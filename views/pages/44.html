  My drift towards the very origins of Unix was certain to lead me to the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) at some point. Linux 
  was built on Unix principles, but it isn’t Unix in the genetic sense. On the other hand, as rightfully stated on Wikipedia, BSD 
  <b>is</b> Unix, but can only call itself Unix-like due to licensing of the original AT&T UNIX operating system (notice the 
  upper case spelling). Regardless, I decided to take a brave step into this genuine Unix ecosystem.

  Much like there are multiple Linux distributions, BSD also has its derivatives – FreeBSD, PC-BSD, GhostBSD (both based on FreeBSD), 
  OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonflyBSD, etc. The major difference between Linux and BSD is the architecture of the OS. Linux is just the 
  kernel with a loosely attached userland (apps, system daemons, etc.) defined by individual distributions. BSD is a complete 
  operating system (kernel + core userland covering basic functionalities, like storage device mounting and networking). On the 
  FreeBSD website this comparison is nicely outlined a a dichotomy between order (BSD) and chaos (Linux). I myself prefer order!

  The other major difference is package management. BSD operating systems are <em>source-first</em>, meaning that the primary mode 
  of software distribution is via source code, together with instructions (Makefiles) and scripts describing how to build it. Since 
  core OS functionalities are covered by the base system, the (admin) user has full control over installed software. On FreeBSD apps 
  can be either compiled from source, selecting optional features through an ncurses menu, or installed as binary packages, much like 
  it is done on most Linux distributions. Because packages are originally built from the Ports Collection (the source tree for 
  software), they work almost seamlessly with software compiled by the user. Almost, because packages bear the default set of 
  features. As soon as we decide to cherry-pick features, it's better to stick to the Ports Collection. Most Linux distributions are 
  <em>binary-first</em>, however some Linux distributions follow the BSDs more closely (Gentoo, Void Linux, CRUX, Slackware, etc.).

  The main source of knowledge about FreeBSD is the famous <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/" 
  target="--blank">FreeBSD Handbook</a>. Perhaps only the Arch Linux and Gentoo wikis can compare to the completeness of the Handbook, 
  which easily covers over 90% of FreeBSD. I think this is important, because sometimes one might lose Internet connection or even 
  worse and having the Handbook directly accessible on the drive is a life-saver! Also, it means that there is a single source of 
  information one can always refer to when in doubt about the OS.

  One last important thing to remember is that while both Linux and FreeBSD are Unix-like operating systems, FreeBSD is NOT Linux. 
  That sounds absurdly obvious, but it means that many terminal commands native to Linux may not work on FreeBSD or work differently. 
  Even something as common as <code>cp</code> (copy) has a slightly different behavior on FreeBSD. In general, the BSDs require a 
  different mindset and familiarity with their quirks. However, since FreeBSD uses a lot of GNU components, one can expect all of the 
  major desktop environments and apps to be readily available through the Ports Collection. In fact, the vastness of the Ports 
  Collection with over 24000 packages easily eclipses smaller Linux projects.
